**************************SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS *******************

# PyCity Schools Analysis- Parents choose charter schools with less then 2000 #people help ensure their student has high test scores! 

<!-- -I. Introduction
- The purpose of this paper is to describe anlaysis cmopleted on charter and district schools. The focus on charter   -schools and their performance compared to district schools was at the center of the analysis. Findings are as         -follows.

- Charter schools perfomed in all catagories: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score,% Passing Math, % Passing      - Reading,% Overall Passing. We did find some annomolys in the data given we had students in highschool showing       -"doctorate-work" in the - dataset. Further interigation of the data set should be performed prior to publishing       - findings. 

II. Charter School Performance
- Charter schools perform better in all categories including the below: 
-fig 1.0
--------------Average Math Score|Average Reading Score|%Passing Math|%Passing Readin|%Overall Passing
-School Type					
        -Charter	83.473852	    83.896421	           93.620830	96.586489	   90.432244
        -District	76.956733	    80.966636	           66.548453	80.799062	   53.672208

III. Comparison with District Schools
- A 37% higher overall passing rate was observed for students in Charter Schools vs District.  This significant -      - difference in overall passing percentage between charter schools and district schools was a trend seen across all    - catagories as represnted in figure 1.0 above. 
- As a parent we feel this finding is important for our fellow parents and we suggest parents entertain the following - Charter-school choices as options with their children when deciding educational institutions. Ranked in oder of     - performance. Fig 2.0

- Fig 2.0 -Highest ranked charter schools 
-1. Cabrera High  
-2. Thomas High School	 
-3. Griffin High School	 
-4. Wilson High School	 
-5. Pena High School

IV. School Spending and Test Scores
- In the comparison we observed the highest budgets by school, eg. Bailey High School, correlated with  the lowest     - overall pass rate of any school. Budget = $$3,124,928.00, % Overall pass = 54.642283%.
% - The data showed a corelation of high budget with high student body populaiton.  Which we feel maybe an underlying    - root cause for large budgeted schools not yeilding higher test scores in their student populations. 
% - These findings are important for understanding how to improve education outcomes as well as parents lookoing for   - educational institutions for their children.  Lower overall student body sized-schools had signficantly better       - testing results. 2000 students total and under represented 100% of the highest scoring shools for testing.  

% V. Data Limitations
% - The data did have an issue where we observed a high school senoir in a district school where a students had a "Dr" - in their title.
% - From our point of view this data-anomoly, may pose a limitation around the validity of the data set and warrents    - futher interrogation of the dataset before publishing any findings
 

% VI. Conclusion
% - As parents looking for a school sytem the data analysis supported looking for a charter school. Specifially one with - a total size in student population of 2000 or less. School budgets weren't necessicarly a sign of higher test       - scores. Contrarian to that the size of the school was more important to higher scores then money spent per student. 
% - We Reiterate the limitations of the data and the need for further investigation given it's non-sensical a student - - could have a doctoratre.
